# assignmenthelper
Collaborative tool for students to help them complete and organise assignments.

Made this responsive Django webapp in college for a hackathon. This aims to solve a major problem prevalent in colleges that still 
stress on rote learning. Share and learn from other students and quickly complete all your assignments! <br/>

Features <br/>
1.) Students can create or join groups <br/>
2.) Students can upload assignments to a group <br/>
3.) All assignments in the group are show in priorty (depending on due date, views and other factors) <br/>
4.) All students that are members of a group can add assignments (collection of image files) <br/>
5.) All students can view assignments in a gallery <br/>
6.) Each group has a PIN that can be used to join a group. Share it with your classmates to enable them to join and
contribute to your group. <br/>

We've decided to move to an app based version from the web version. So sharing the code
for any one else to learn!

** I'd highly recommend you to use Amazon S3 for hosting the images **
